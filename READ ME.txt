
 ATM Interface
The project contain a simple interface for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using C# Windows Application.  
Project Description:
ATM interface where a user can log in using a PIN. The system is pre-loaded with data for 5 users, including their PINs and account balances, which is 
hardcoded into the program.
Features:
• User Login: The user should be able to log in using a PIN. If a user enters the wrong PIN three 
times, the system is blocked, with a message “service is disabled, enter admin pin", and 
special admin pin is required to unlock the system.
• Withdraw Cash: The user should be able to withdraw cash in two ways:
o Quick Withdraw: Pre-defined buttons for quick withdrawal of set amounts.
o Custom Withdraw: Input a specific amount for withdrawal.
• Error Checking: The system should check if the withdrawal amount is available in the user’s 
account. If the input amount is more than the available balance, an error message should be 
displayed.
• Numeric Input Validation: The system should validate that the user inputs only numeric values.
• Pop-up Windows: Use pop-up windows to display messages to the user, such as successful 
withdrawal, insufficient balance, etc.
• Button Disabling: Certain buttons should be disabled while a process is underway to prevent 
accidental button presses.
Info:
• The project is implemented as a C# Windows Application.
• No database or external files are needed as all data is hardcoded.
• The interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
